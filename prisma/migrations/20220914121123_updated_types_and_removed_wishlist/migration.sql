/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `products` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `products` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - You are about to drop the `wishlists` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
